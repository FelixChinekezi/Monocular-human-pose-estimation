Single-Person Pose Estimation

Vision-based monocular human pose estimation, as one of the most fundamental and challenging problems in computer vision, aims to obtain posture of the human body from input images or video sequences. The recent developments of deep learning techniques have been brought significant progress and remarkable breakthroughs in the field of human pose estimation. This survey extensively reviews the recent deep learning-based 2D and 3D human pose estimation methods published since 2014. This
paper summarizes the challenges, main frameworks, benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics, performance comparison, and discusses some promising future research directions.

A convolutional neural network model that runs on RGB images and predicts human joint locations of a single person. The model is designed to be run in the browser using softwares such as Jupyter, Tensorflow.js or on devices using TF Lite in real-time, targeting movement/fitness activities. This variant: MoveNet.SinglePose.Lightning is a lower capacity model (compared to MoveNet.SinglePose.Thunder) that can run 50FPS on most modern laptops while achieving good performance.
